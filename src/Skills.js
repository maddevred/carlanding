<p1>"They did a wonderful job detailing my car. My car feels like new again. I certainly will be using ECleanz again, and I highly recommend you give them a shot."</p1>
<br></br>
<p2>"They did awesome. I've had my truck for over 5 years and it's always been outside so the paint was pretty rough. They made it look really good, fixed a lot of dull areas, cleaned up minor scratches, and made the inside look brand new."</p2>
<br></br>
<p3>" I cannot say enough good things about TrendSettas. The owner is friendly, thoughtful and professional. The courteous employees take pride in their work and it shows. I took my car to be detailed and it felt like I left with a brand new car.   I will definitely return."</p3>
